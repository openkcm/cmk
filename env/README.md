# IMPORTANT 
**DO NOT CHANGE SET VALUES ON THE BLUEPRINTS, THESE ARE INTENDED TO ACT AS TEMPLATES**

Blueprints is a directory includes files that are supposed to act as blueprints for credentials.

The blueprints are copied into env/secret where it's safe to set the credentials as it's an ignored directory.

To create the blueprints into the secret directory
```
make create-empty-secrets
```
